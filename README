Pyjamas
-------

Pyjamas is a port of Google Web Toolkit to Python, and thus enables
the development of AJAX applications in Python.

For more information, see:

Pyjamas-Desktop
---------------

A parallel project is Pyjamas-Desktop: a port of Pyjamas to the
desktop, using WebKit (http://webkit.org).

Both projects support exactly the same set of widgets; exactly the
same API; provide exactly the same functionality.

Pyjamas runs your application in a Web Browser; Pyjamas-Desktop runs
exactly the same python application on the Desktop.

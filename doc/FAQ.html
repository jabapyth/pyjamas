Pyjamas: Write your own AJAX Framework
</span></big>
</div>
<h2> <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">Pyjamas</span> FAQ</h2>

This is the FAQ on Pyjamas, the python-to-javascript compiler and
Python Web Widget Toolkit.  Any questions not answered here please
contact pyjamas-dev@groups.google.com

<h3> What is <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">pyjamas</span>?</h3>
<p>
 <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span>
is a stand-alone python to javascript compiler, an AJAX framework / library
and a Widget set API.  
</p>
<h3> Is pyjamas like "yet another AJAX framework?" </h3>
<p>
Nope.  "standard" AJAX frameworks and widget sets are written in javascript,
a low-level alien language with weird complexities that is often confused
with not only the browsers it runs on but also the DOM model set of functions
that are provided as standard with the browsers.  When you use a "standard"
AJAX framework, there is an expectation that you will just "use" it - never
look at the framework, never get involved with its development or improvement,
and if that AJAX framework doesn't do what you want, tough luck - find another
one.
</p>
<p>
Pyjamas is a totally different approach: you are given a
comprehensive set of base classes and modules - written almost
98.5% in python - and you can then write your own applications,
classes and modules and call it "My Own AJAX Framework".  And, as
you are writing in a much higher level language than Javascript,
it's a darn sight easier.
</p>

<h3> Do I have to know any Javascript? </h3>
<p>
Nope.
</p>

<h3> Do I have to know any Web Programming? </h3>
<p>
Nope.
</p>
<p>
It helps if you know a little bit about how CSS works, because
the Pyjamas User-Interface widgets are designed around "function" and
"purpose", not "form" or "look".
</p>

<h3> Why not? </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas Web development actually has more in common with Python-Qt4
and Python-GTK2 than it does with "traditional" web development.
The base widgets (of which there are over 50) have almost exact
corresponding analogues in Desktop Widget sets.  The nice thing about
Pyjamas, though, when compared to the Desktop Widget frameworks is that you
get "true" HTML / CSS interoperability, and "true" plugin support such as
Adobe Flash, all for free.
</p>

<h3> I've never done User-Interfaces before - how do I get started? </h3>
<p>
We get quite a number of people who have never done user-interface
programming before in their lives on the pyjamas-dev mailing lists,
let alone having done any web programming: you're in good company.
</p>
<p>
Start with the <a href="./getting_started.html">"getting started"</a>
tutorial, ignoring the first paragraphs because they don't
apply to you!  Many web designers actually have to "unlearn"
their expectations that this is going to be horrendously painful,
and you are at a distinct advantage because you've not experienced
their disillusionment and frustration of the past decade, over CSS,
browser and AJAX incompatibilities.
</p>

<h3> I'm a bit underwhelmed by the apparent lack of documentation </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas is an independent free software project that is used by people
who prefer to actually get on with the job of writing apps, rather than
glorying or revelling in the frustration of "traditional" web development.
Hitting your head against a wall continuously every day doesn't hurt any
more when you stop doing it, and much of "traditional" web development -
of dealing with all the browser incompatibilities at a low level - can be
considered to be the same as brick-wall-nutting.
</p>
<p>
In other words, you're here gaining the benefit of the experience
of people who have spent quite some time searching out - and then
improving - the Pyjamas Technology, to make their own lives easier.
If there's an area which isn't clearly documented, you might like
to consider funding them to tell you about it.
</p>
<p>
That having been said, there is actually one heck of a lot of documentation:
see the main <a href="http://pyjs.org">Pyjamas</a> site for links to the
tutorials, the Pyjamas Book, the API reference guides, the Showcase
example which includes source code examples for each type of Widget and
Panel (that can be cut/pasted into your app), and much more.  If that
wasn't enough, the GWT User-Interface modules on which the Pyjamas UI
modules are based are so similar that even the GWT documentation is still
relevant and useful.
</p>

<h3> I'm a bit underwhelmed by the apparent lack of documentation on XML and DOM</h3>
<p>
That's because there's a ton of documentation on the W3C standard DOM Model
and the W3C standard browser XML standard, and duplicating that in the
Pyjamas project would be a great deal of work and would imply that the
Pyjamas project is somehow an authority over-and-above the W3C.
Use a google search for "W3C DOM XML", "W3C DOM", "W3C DOM Javascript"
and other such searches to find so much documentation and help on the
subject that you'll be staring at it for days.
</p>

<h3> My application doesn't work.  What do I do, and why isn't Pyjamas helping? </h3>
<p>
There are so many things you should be doing to determine the cause
of "it ain't working" it's almost unreal.  But before answering
in more detail, it's important that you know what pyjamas is and
is not.  First off: pyjamas is a compiler, not a debugger.  It's the
equivalent of "gcc".  Actually, if you know how gcc works, pyjsbuild
is the equivalent of "gcc" and pyjscompile is the equivalent of,
for example, "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.3.3/cc1".  In other
words, gcc and pyjsbuild are the general-purpose "front-ends",
and cc1 and pyjscompile are the actual nitty-gritty compilers.
</p>
<p>
You <i>need</i> to be aware of this because you cannot expect pyjamas,
a specialist compiler, to also take on the task of being the debugger, or
the virtual machine under which the javascript executes, or any other
task <i>other</i> than actual compiling.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, here are some things that you can do:
<ul>
<li /> Add the -d option to the build process: pyjsbuild -d {myapp.py} 
       as this will enable a horrendous amount of extra output in the
       application, including actually placing the line numbers and
       module name into the javascript output, for each and every single
       line of code being executed (!)  Also, a stacktrace will be
       recorded so that if there are any exceptions in your application,
       an Alert will come up with the full stacktrace (just like in
       "real" python applications).
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Watch the Javascript Console.
<li /> Did we say, and emphasise enough, that you need to watch the Javascript
       Console?
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console.
<li /> You need to watch the javascript console because that is where
       runtime javascript errors are shown.  Most web applications are written
       so badly that the errors are usually silently ignored by browsers,
       so as not to frighten users.  As a developer, you cannot ignore
       the errors (not if you expect to actually be able to write an app,
       that is...)
<li /> If you are using Firefox, install <i>both</i> Venkman <b>and</b>
       Firebug.  You will need them both.  Use them.  get used to using them.
<li /> If you are using IE, install the Script Debugger.  use it.
<li /> If you were debugging a c or c++ application, you would be using gdb.
       The javascript console, Firebug, Venkman, the Microsoft Script Debugger:
       these are all the equivalent of gdb.  use them.  You will suck at
       being a Web developer if you do not use these tools.
<li /> Install <a href="http://pyjd.org">Pyjamas Desktop</a> and run your
       application under that.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Overall, then, it's important to remember that pyjamas is a compiler,
not an interpreter, not a debugger, syntax checker or anything else other
than a compiler.  This may be a bit of a shock if you are used to the
python interpreter throwing helpful stack traces for you - which is what
Pyjamas-Desktop is there for: it actually runs Pyjamas applications
<i>as real python</i>, not as javascript.

</p>

<h3> I want to throw some debug output onto the screen, how do I best do that?</h3>

<p>
There are four main ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li /> If you like, throw in lots of "alerts" into your application.
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import Window
Window.alert("Hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> My favourite: add some HTML to the end of the page:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas.ui.RootPanel import RootPanel
from pyjamas.ui.HTML import HTML
RootPanel().add(HTML("hello, here is an error")
</pre>
<li /> Another approach is to follow what examples/libtest/write.py does,
which you should just consider blatantly copying:
<pre class="code">
from pyjamas import DOM

def getBodyElement():
    JS(""" return $doc.body; """)

def write(text):
    global data, element
    data += text
    DOM.setInnerHTML(element, data)

def writebr(text):
    write(text + r"&lt;br /&gt;\n")

data = ""
element = DOM.createDiv()
DOM.appendChild(getBodyElement(), element)
</pre>
<li /> If you have followed the advice above of the previous question,
and have installed Firebug, then just insert a "print" statement, exactly
as you would in "standard" python.  All output is directed to "console.write",
where Firebug will add an object called "console" to the global namespace
of your browser, and will "write" anything that goes to that console.write()
function into a special debugging window.  If you haven't installed Firebug,
and you use "print", you will get an error (because there will be no object
called "console") in your browser's global namespace.  So make your life
easier, and install Firebug.  or not.
</ul>
<p>
A Window.alert is the easiest but also the most annoying.  It has the
advantage however of not disrupting the screen layout.  Perhaps
some day someone will do something really sophisticated, like provide
a "logger" module which throws up a nice separate window.
</p>

<h3> The output from Pyjamas is <i>really</i> verbose.  I don't like that! </h3>
<p>
Pyjamas is a compiler - it's a specialist tool that focusses specifically
on the job of turning python into javascript.  It does <i>not</i>
include "compression" technology.  That task is done by specialist
technology such as the "YUI Javascript Compressor", the use of which
will make it damn hard for you to debug an application as it completely
trashes all of the names of functions and variables.  So only make use
of compressors if you absolutely have to.
</p>
<p>
HTTP 1.1 GZip Compression is usually enabled by default in both
browsers and Web Servers, giving anywhere between an 8:1 and a 10:1
compression ratio in network traffic of pyjamas-compiled output.
So, although the output from pyjamas looks scarily large, it's
actually not as bad as it looks.  500k is not uncommon: the actual
amount of network traffic can be as little as 50k to 80k, which you
can verify by installing a network sniffer on your network.  So,
you actually get the best of both worlds: human-readable javascript
and efficient transfer of your application to the users.
</p>

<h3> The output from Pyjamas is still too verbose.  What do I do? </h3>
<p>
If for example your app is so large that you are hitting, for example,
the limits of GAE, you can switch on "dynamic module" compilation
(pyjsbuild -m).  This option will split your app into several shared
javascript files, one per python module.  It gives something like a
65% reduction in the size of the application cache files, across the
five supported browsers (Opera, Safari, Netscape, Old Mozilla and IE).
It's only just been added (to Pyjamas 0.5) so a) be advised b) watch
this space.
</p>

<h3> I'm doing JSONRPC with pyjamas, but my app isn't working.  </h3>
<p>
You should immediately stop trying to do too much, and eliminate pyjamas
from the equation.  Download
<a href="http://lkcl.net/jsonrpclib.tgz">jsonrpclib.tgz</a> and add
some python-based client-side code to the <i>server-side</i> testing.
As you are a good web developer, who follows good code standard practices,
this should have already occurred to you and it just temporarily slipped
your mind that there should be an automated test suite based on something
like jsonrpclib.tgz which you can use to <i>prove</i> to yourself that
the JSONRPC server-side services of your app are absolutely perfect.
You already considered the distinct advantages of being able to do
automated tests such as pretending to be a user, interacting with the
server-side forms, adding and deleting of records etc., but you had
juuust not quite got round to doing that yet.  well - now you have to.
</p>
<p>
Once you have demonstrated to your satisfaction that there is nothing
wrong with the JSONRPC services, you can then reintroduce Pyjamas,
as a second client, into the equation.  The difference between then
and now is that you now <i>know</i> that there is nothing wrong with
the JSONRPC services, server-side.  So, anything that's wrong has to be
something like you've specified the wrong URL in the use of the
pyjamas.JSONService module.  Check that the URL is the same as the
one that you used in the client-side usage of the python jsonrpclib.
</p>
<p>
You <b>have</b> to remember that you are using AJAX, with JSONRPC. So,
the same standard rules apply: you can <b>not</b> access AJAX URLs
other than those which match the URL from where the web browser downloaded
the HTML and the Javascript.  In other words, if your app is downloaded
from http://fred.foo.com/myapp.html, then you can <b>not</b> put
http://fred.foo.com:8080/jsonservice as the URL for the JSONRPC service,
you can <b>not</b> put http://somewhere.else.com as the URL.  It
<b>has</b> to be http://fred.foo.com/somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the world where people used to use AJAX to do cross-site
scripting attacks, downloading viruses and doing phishing attacks and
other crap, but can't any more, and you, as a developer, have to pay
for that.
</p>

<h3> I've upgraded to Pyjamas 0.5 (or above) and I get a blank screen.  </h3>
<p>
You should have read the CHANGELOG, which says this:
<pre>
    convert app "loading" to require the use of "if __name__ == '__main__'"
    bringing pyjamas into line with "standard" python.  apps can convert with
    contrib/pyjamas_0.4-0.5_upgrade/add_name_main.py to add a small codefragment
    at the end: "app = MyApp(); app.onModuleLoad()"
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In other words, Pyjamas 0.4 and below used to spoon-feed you by calling
a function "onModuleLoad()" in the exact same class as named after your
application.  As this is somewhat tacky, and places an unnecessary restriction
onto how you can lay out your app, it was removed, and replaced with something
that is much more akin to how a "standard" desktop python app would work.
</p>
<p>
The consequences are that your apps will, if you don't explicitly do anything,
do absolutely nothing.  So, when you get a blank screen, that is actually
technically correct!  Declare an instance of your app's class and call its
onModuleLoad() function.

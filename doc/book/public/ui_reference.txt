= Functions =
 * HTMLPanel_createUniqueId()
 * RootPanel(element=None)
{{-method
The function which is used to obtain a Root Panel, to which
all widgets must ultimately be added.

@param element: element can be None, in which case the default
                root panel is returned.
                element can be a string, in which case the
                widget in the underlying DOM model with the
                'id' given by element is returned.
                element can also be a node in the underlying DOM model.
                A good way to think of this is in terms of an
                HTML document.  if element is None, the HTML
                "body" is returned.  if element is a string,
                getElementById('element') is returned.

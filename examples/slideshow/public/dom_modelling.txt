= Why use DOM Model manipulation? =
 * DOM Modelling is the key to a successful easy widget set
   ** Browser technology tolerant of poor layout, for two decades
   ** Rules regarding "repaint" well established
 * Fully-featured widget set already exists
   ** Text, markup, fonts, SVG (2D), plugins, buttons, blah blah
   ** you just gotta access it!
= What's available? =
 * Webkit
   ** Didn't have a free-software DOM manipulator
   ** (it does now)
 * Python-KDE3
   ** Grand-daddy of Webkit!
   ** PyKHTML
 * XulRunner
   ** PyXPComExt / PyDOM for "embedded" (chrome)
   ** NsDOM for python-controlled apps (?)

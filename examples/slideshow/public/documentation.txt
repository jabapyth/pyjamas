Lots and lots of documentation for Pyjamas
 * Google Web Toolkit API is still relevant
 * pydoc-generated (docstrings) - http://pyjs.org/api
 * Pyjamas-generated application (based on pydoc)
 * Showcase - includes worked examples
 * Tutorial - "controls" demo
 * Getting Started - http://pyjs.org
 * Wiki on http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas
All of these are "useful".
There's always the source.

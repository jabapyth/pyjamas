= Pyjamas - The Python Web Toolkit Family =
 * What is Pyjamas? 
   ** Port of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to Python
   ** Stand-alone Python-to-Javascript compiler
   ** AJAX Widget set (similar to PyQt4, PyGtk2 and wxWidgets)
 * Why use it?
   ** Saves time and effort: write in Python (not Javascript)
   ** It's very cool
   ** Takes away all the HTML and AJAX pain...
 * How does it work?
   ** Compiles application classes and modules to Javascript
   ** Compiles hybrid Widget set to Javascript
   ** Runs in Web Browser
 * Conceptually, Pyjamas takes getting used to
   ** No more disillusionment with dire AJAX awfulness
   ** No more "browser incompatibilities"
   ** No more CSS nastiness

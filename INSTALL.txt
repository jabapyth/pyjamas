Installing Pyjamas
==================

System Installation
===================

If you are installing pyjamas system-wide, for use by MORE THAN ONE
developer of the same multi-user system, run the following command.
Otherwise DO NOT run setup.py, see below (bootstrap.py).

 python setup.py install

You *may* need to specify --install-data={pickasuitablelocation}

The commands pyjscompile and pyjsbuild will be installed;
the boilerplate web templates, the pyjamas "builtin" libraries
and the UI Widget libraries will be installed as data libraries
which pyjscompile and pyjsbuild will know about.   The default
path is:

    {sys.prefix}/share/pyjamas

You can over-ride this default location with the PYJSPREFIX
environment variable.

Developer Sandbox Setup
=======================

In this directory run::

 python bootstrap.py

The files ``./bin/pyjsbuild`` and ``./bin/pyjscompile`` will be created,
custom-tailored with hard-coded paths specific to the exact absolute
location that the bootstrap.py command is run from.

To build pyjamas apps see ``./bin/pyjsbuild --help``

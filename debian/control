Description: Python Web Widget Toolkit and Python-to-Javascript Compiler
  Pyjamas is a stand-alone python to javascript compiler, an AJAX
  framework / library and a Desktop-like Widget set API.
  .
  Pyjamas is typically used for the development of "Web 2.0"
  RIAs, where the application can be almost exclusively written
  in Python, instead of Javascript, yet compiled to run in the
  user's browser.
  .
  Pyjamas does not do the "usual" static AJAX javascript framework
  paradigm but instead provides the developer with the tools and
  the libraries to write their own Web 2.0 AJAX Framework, as if
  they were programming and working with a standard Desktop Widget
  Set.
  .
  The Pyjamas User-Interface Widget Set is very very similar to that
  of Python-Qt4 and Python-Gtk2, with the distinct advantage that
  applications run in all major web browsers, with absolutely no plugins
  required (only javascript need be enabled).  Additional advantages
  over the use of standard Desktop Widget sets are that Pyjamas provides
  direct access to the full set of HTML features - CSS, NPAPI Plugins
  such as Adobe Flash, and SVG 2D Canvas.  Are all directly available.
